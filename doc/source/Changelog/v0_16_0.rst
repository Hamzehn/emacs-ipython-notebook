v0.16.0
-------

Support for auto-complete as a completion backend in ein is now deprecated and
will eventually disappear completely. For code completion use either
company-mode by setting :el:symbol:`ein:completion-backend` to
:el:symbol:`ein:use-company-backend` or enable polymode (see
:el:symbol:`ein:polymode`) to enable completion via whatever native support you
have configured for ``python-mode``.

Support for polymode is much improved and sometime in the next release or two
it will become the default mode of interaction in notebook buffers.

As always, numerous bug fixes and pull requests. 32 PR's this time around, see
PR's `483`_ - `553`_. You will also notice the majority of these are from the prolific

to run into him in your travels.
